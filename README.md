### 5. Loop Reminder ➰
Allows you to create reminders that repeat indefinitely at a fixed interval (every X minutes or hours). The next reminder is scheduled when the current one triggers. Unlike the “Repeatable Reminder” feature (which repeats only a few times at 5-minute intervals), recurring reminders continue until you manually delete them from the Reminder Inbox.

### 6. Repeatable Reminder 🔁
This feature repeats your reminders up to 3 times at 5-minute intervals, ensuring you're alerted even if you miss the initial prompt.
